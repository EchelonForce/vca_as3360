v1 testing
First build: 
CV a little off:
  pots seem to exercise full range but a lot of the pot range is wasted?
  CV 0-5V instead of 0-10V?
  measured at the pin on the as3360, the CV 0-10 goes 0-2V as designed, but the data sheet has max gain listed at 1.7-1.8V, so 2V is a bit too high. Need to adjust dividers into U3 because the non-inverting buffer has gain of 2 I didn't account for...I think I want about 1.6V at the AS3360 so I'll shoot for 0.8V at the input of U3, so 390k/33k...looks good.



v1 to v2 changes
used 33k instead of 50k
used 390k instead of 400k
U3 is label tl074 but it should be lm358, swapped with U1 which is also wrong.


May need to swap for smd tl072's
